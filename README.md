# BrainCT_CNN_Model
An neural network assignment from Machine Learning using Convolutional Neural Network 

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/code/metamadyeth/ml-project-image-classification

Original code from Google colab, the code assumes that the dataset is already in the google drive. The notebook makes a connection to the google drive and extracts the dataset. Data processing techniques are also referenced in the code as many other have worked on this dataset. The dataset is convert into a DataFame with the path of each sample under 'Path' column and 'label' as the label of each images. 

Method displayImage(path) utilizes  IPython.display library and takes a path and displays the image.
